# **Introduction **

It is a basic calculator that will allow users to perform operations in mathematics( Arithimetic, Trigonometric, Matrices, Conversion etc) b However, the input has to be provided by user. The input values can be from any integer to even a number with decimals. Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate all the basic operations.
# **Features**

- It can do all basic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
- Logarithmic operations, Exponential operations are also available.
- Power functions, Factorial and Conversions which are helpful for students are added.
- Basic Trigonometric Operations are also available.
- Basic Matrix Operations are also available.
- It has double precision.
